# Hackaton Poly2019 : MeshChat

Here can be found the source code for the Android App. It creates a Bluetooth forum, where devices can pair and exchange text messages. Our goal is to bounce messages on the mesh to allow any peer to peer communication. 

## Installation Instructions

The APK is available in the main directory, but the source code can also be opened in Android Studio and recompiled.
